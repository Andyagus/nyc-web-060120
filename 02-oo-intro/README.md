        - symbols that represent the binary code 
            - dictionary with key/value pairs
                - kind of like a hash
            - Contain instructions on performing a task
                - can invoke methods

    - Why do we use objects?
        - A thing
        - modularity
        - contributes to the bigger picture of everything

    - What objects have we worked with?
        - "string"
        - classes
        - arrays
